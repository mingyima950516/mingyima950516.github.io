## Background 

The Super Friend E-commerce platform includes three parts: (i) Client APP, (ii) Merchant mobile APP, (iii) Merchant admin website. The most important part is the client APP which including product search, browsing, transaction, etc. Merchant mobile APP are a mobile application for merchants to manage orders, goods, and distribution staff planning routes. 

The development of the APP was based on hybrid-app. But we did not use traditional hybrid-app framework like phonegap, appcan, etc. Because these framework has some sufficiencies in caching, effectiveness and so on. So i developed an hybrid-app framework in Android platform for this project to make up for these shortcomings. Furthermore, this hybrid framework is also used in subsequent projects. But the above framework current only supports Android platform.

 **[Note:]**  Hybrid-app is a kind of development mode that let smart phones run javascript,html and css codes. In addition, developer can write code once time, and run it in different platforms such as Android, IOS.
