## Background 

The user identification and browsing tracking of user access on the Internet is very important. For example: 1) Sometimes users do not login on the website and have cookies disabled, but the website still needs to accurately identify the user. 2) In some areas of electronic finance or electronic payment, an attacker may disguise user's identity or cookie information. In these cases, browser fingerprinting can be used as a tool to locate client users accurately .

The system gets some basic information by client and user devices through the browser. And upload this information to the cloud. This information is processed and filtered. Then, some traditional machine learning or deep learning methods are used to identify the user.
