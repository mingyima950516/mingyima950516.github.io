title: "Sitting Posture Recognition"
featured-img: sp
---

Correct writing posture is very important for people. Especially for young people. If the writing posture is not correct, it will not only cause the spine to bend, but also cause vision loss, etc.

## Background 

This project was done during my internship at Lenovo Research.

This project is to record people in front of the table through the camera on the table lamp. Then push the video stream into the sitting recognition algorithm for recognition. It will then analyze the sitting posture of the person in front of the camera for a period of time, and will send the information to the PC screen and smartphone for display or send alert information.

This project uses multiple types of identification algorithms such as single frame recognition and time-series-based recognition algorithms. At the same time, some methods are used to optimize the algorithm, such as using DCN to control the receptive field. In addition, using CAM map and other tools to analyze the focus of the neural network.

## Responsibilities

I responsible for algorithm development and debugging.
