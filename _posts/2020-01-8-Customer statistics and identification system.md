## Background 


This project is a sub-project of the "Store Expert" project. The purpose of this project is to identify and statistics the number of customers through the camera at the store entrance. Through customer identification, the consumer preference can be pushed to the mobile phone of the store staff at the first time. This will help staff make precise marketing for customers. On the other hand, by counting the number of customers entering the store, combined with the number of consumption, we can calculate indicators such as the closing ratio of the store.

This system has not only been used in chain stores, but also has been used in some exhibition(As shown in below figures).
